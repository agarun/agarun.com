## Technologies ðŸ§°

### Tooling

- ESLint
  - The ESLint config (`.eslintrc.json`) extends the `create-react-app` config, Next.js config, and includes a Prettier plugin
- Prettier
- Husky
  - Pre-commit hooks that run tools like ESLint & Prettier on modified files (via `lint-staged`)

### Theming

- Color modes and theming tokens are implemented with CSS variables (custom properties)
  - [Josh Comeau's dark mode guide](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/), [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), [useDarkMode](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode) were really useful resources to avoid FOUC.
